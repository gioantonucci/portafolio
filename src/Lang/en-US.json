Currently, I'm also studying UX design because I believe it's crucial to create digital products that are both attractive and user-friendly. I'm a versatile person who can adapt to any situation quickly. Apart from my career as a developer, I also run a sales business. This experience has taught me to be organized and work efficiently under high-pressure situations and I have developed strong communication and customer service skills. I am also adept at problem-solving and decision-making, and I have a keen eye for detail.",
